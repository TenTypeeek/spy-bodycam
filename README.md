['dashcam'] = { label = 'Dashcam', weight = 500, stack = false, close = true },
```
### ESX
```lua
INSERT INTO `items` (`name`, `label`, `weight`, `rare`, `can_remove`) VALUES ('bodycam', 'Bodycam', 1, 0, 1);
INSERT INTO `items` (`name`, `label`, `weight`, `rare`, `can_remove`) VALUES ('dashcam', 'Dashcam', 1, 0, 1);
```
7. Run the sql file in installfiles folder
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `spy_bodycam` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `job` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `videolink` longtext NOT NULL,
  `street` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `date` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `playername` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=42 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_general_ci;
```
### Setup Fivemerr or Fivemanage

1. Set the `Upload.ServiceUsed` to the desired service in `server/upload_config.lua`:
    ```lua
    Upload.ServiceUsed = 'fivemerr' -- or 'fivemanage'
    ```

2. Create a video-only token and set it in the `Upload.Token` field in `server/upload_config.lua`:
